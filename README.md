# Floating Point Adder
Verilog code for Floating Point Adder.

This repository contains the verilog code for implementation of a floating point (IEEE 754 standard) adder. It has been using the simple if-else statement. Also provided is an extensive testbench that covers all possible arithmetic addition cases for the floating point adder.

Flips Flops have been added to the input and output to make the entire system sequential which allows one to find its performance in terms of the timing capabilities and power consumption.

A timing constraint file is also attached to optimise the power consumption and timing factors and environment.
